## Overview üöÄ
The Elastic Path Commerce Cloud Composable Commerce Reference shows how to extend the business capabilities of EPCC with a modular serverless application, featuring:
* an Elasticsearch integration for product data,
* API stats resource showing version and last deployment time.

The project structure can serve as a blueprint for building and deploying modular serverless applications.

## Documentation üìñ

### API
Once deployed, this project will provide the following API:
```
/_version
/{store_id}/searches/{resource_name}
/{store_id}/webhooks/search/{resource_name}
/{store_id}/oauth
/{store_id}/products
/{store_id}/orders
/{store_id}/...
```
`{resource_name}` indicates a generic integration pattern. In this case only `products` are supported since the minimal implementation provided here only indexes product data. However, this can easily be extended to support other EPCC data such as categories, customers, orders etc.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following configured:
- [Elastic Path Commerce Cloud account](https://dashboard.elasticpath.com/login)
- [Amazon Web Services account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/start) with basic authentication

### Development Tools
Building or extending EPCC Composable Commerce Reference requires the following software:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [AWS Command Line Interface 2.0.26 or later](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Terraform 0.13.2 or later](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

### Building and Deploying
```bash
# Clone the Git repository
git clone https://github.com/elasticpath/epcc-composable-commerce-reference.git

# Go into the cloned directory
cd epcc-composable-commerce-reference

# Install all the dependencies for all sub-projects
npm install

# Configure the parameters in the file config/config.json.
# See section "Configuration Parameter Descriptions" below.

# Build and deploy:
npm run start
```
`npm run start` will build the project, deploy infrastructure such as API gateway and Lambda functions into AWS, and configure EPCC with the appropriate integration webhook URL.

> `npm run start` is equivalent to the command `npm run build && npm run deploy && npm run config`.

Once everything is deployed and configured you can start the included integration test to ensure everything is working as expected:
```bash
npm run integration-test
```

Available commands:
```
npm run start
npm run test
npm run build       
npm run deploy
npm run config
npm run integration-test
npm run unconfig
npm run undeploy
npm run clean
```

### API Endpoint
```
api_endpoint: https://{apigw_id_etc}.amazonaws.com/dev/{epcc_store_id}
```
